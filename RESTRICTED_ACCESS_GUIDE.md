# How to Allow Restricted Settings on Android 13+

If you installed this application outside of the Google Play Store (e.g., via a direct APK download or sideloading), Android 13 and newer versions will automatically restrict its access to certain sensitive permissions, such as **Usage Access**.

When you try to grant these permissions, you might see a warning message saying:
> **"Restricted setting. For your security, this setting is currently unavailable."**

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to bypass this restriction and allow the necessary settings for the application.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open Device Settings**: Go to your Android device's main **Settings** app.
2. **Go to Apps**: Tap on **Apps** (or **Apps & notifications** / **App management**, depending on your device).
3. **See All Apps**: Tap **See all [Number] apps** or **App list** to view every installed application.
4. **Find the App**: Scroll down or use the search bar to find and tap on this application (e.g., **Usage Access App**).
5. **Open the Menu**: On the App info page, look at the **top-right corner** of the screen and tap the **three vertical dots** (⋮) menu icon.
6. **Allow Restricted Settings**: Tap on the option that says **Allow restricted settings**.
7. **Authenticate**: You may be asked to confirm your identity using your device PIN, pattern, password, or fingerprint.

*Note: If you do not see the "Allow restricted settings" option in the three-dot menu, ensure you have first tried to enable the Usage Access permission, triggered the "Restricted setting" dialog, and then navigated to the App info page.*

## Grant Usage Access

Now that you have allowed restricted settings, you can safely grant the required permission:

1. Return to the app, which should prompt you again, OR go manually to **Settings > Apps > Special app access > Usage access**.
2. Find the application in the list and tap on it.
3. Toggle the switch to turn on **Permit usage access**.

> **Security Note**: This restriction is a built-in Android security feature designed to protect you from malicious apps that abuse sensitive permissions. You should only allow restricted settings for apps that you fully trust.
